    <p>This classic lasagna recipe consists of layers of rich and flavorful components, creating a hearty and satisfying dish. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

        <p>For the meat sauce:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef
        </li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces/425g) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      </ul>

<p>Steps</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well, bring the mixture to a simmer, and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a small amount of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place three lasagna noodles on top.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the mozzarella cheese and a third of the Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Finish with a layer of meat sauce and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.

        </li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This helps the layers set.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your last homemade lasagna!</li>
